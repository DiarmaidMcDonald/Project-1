            Born in Cowgate, Edinburgh, Scotland in 1868 James Connolly was raised alongside his three brothers by his Irish Catholic mother and father.
            Connolly had many jobs when growing up through the slums of Edinburgh, before he decided to follow his brother and join the British army.
            During his peroid in the army, James Connolly spent a lot of his time here in Ireland and it was where he met his wife to be, Lillie Reynolds 
            from Co. Wicklow, to which they had seven children together.

            It was then Connolly got a job as a carter and began being involved in the trades union organisation and the socialist movement over in Scotland.
            Having lost his job in 1896, Connolly decided to move with his family to Dublin where he took up a job offer to act as a paid organiser for the Dublin
            Socialist Club. For the following years, having truly developed his political thoughts on nationalism and socialism he set up the Irish Socialist Republican Party (IRSP),
            and wrote continiously in his paper 'The Workers Republic', which he also published himself. Disappointed by the slow rate of progress in the socialist furture of Ireland, he travelled to America
            in 1903 as a promoter, and returned to Ireland in 1910. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Connolly began working for the Irish Transport and General Workers Union founded by Jim Larkin in Belfast, where he witnessed the divide between the Catholic nationalists and
            the Protestant unionist workers. In 1912, he played a huge part in forming an Irish Labour Party and the following year was consumed by the events of the Dublin Lockout. The 
            Dublin Lockout was a major industrial dispute between the workers and their employers.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a defeat in the Dublin Lockout, Larkin left for America, and it was then Connolly became a particularly dominant figure in Irish Politics.
            Not only that he took over as acting general sectretary of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union but also retained the command of the 
            Irish Citizen Army, the militia he founded in November 1913 to defend the Dublin workers.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the outbreak of World War 1, Connolly never lost sight of his belief for socialism. He beleived at that moment that a national uprising against the British 
            rule in Ireland should be the priority. Come the end of 1915, James Connolly and the Irish Citizen Army, were threathening an armed rebilion which caught the attention 
            of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who were in fact planning their own uprising at the time. From then, Connolly was appointed onto their military Council
            and helped them in planning, in what is known globally as The Easter Rising, at Easter time 1916. Connolly also was one of seven
            people who signed the Proclamation of Ireland which was read out in front of the GPO by Padraig Pearse. 
            James Connolly, Padraig Pearse, Sean Mac Diarmada, Joesph Plunkett, Eamonn Ceannt, Thomas J Clarke, Thomas McDonagh, were the seven men who signed the Promclamation of Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
            Connolly led the Irish Citizen Army during the rising and directed operations from the GPO until their surrender onthe 29th of April, 1916.
            Post surrender, Connolly was brought to Kilmainham Gaol where he was then executed, at 47 years of age, along with other volunteers from the rebilion.
            James Connolly was buried in Arbour Hill cemetery.
